# 🚗 EDA on Automobile Dataset

This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of an automobile dataset aimed at uncovering meaningful insights into how various car features relate to price, fuel efficiency, performance, and more.

## 📌 Objective

To explore, clean, visualize, and derive insights from automobile data by analyzing features like:
- Price
- Horsepower
- Engine size
- Fuel type
- Car make
- Body style

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- Cars with **larger engines** and **higher horsepower** are generally more expensive.
- **Fuel-efficient cars** (higher MPG) tend to be more affordable.
- **Luxury brands** like BMW and Mercedes-Benz had the highest price ranges.
- **Economy brands** like Toyota and Honda were more budget-friendly.
- **Sedans** were the most common body style, but hatchbacks and convertibles had interesting pricing patterns.
- Strong **correlation found** between engine size, horsepower, and price.
